# Explanation with Java references

## Import Statement

```typescript
import { EventEmitter } from 'events';
```

- This is similar to Java's import statement.
- EventEmitter is a core Node.js class used for handling events.
- It's conceptually similar to Java's Observer pattern or event listeners.

## Type Definition

```typescript
type AppConfig = {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  environment: 'development' | 'production' | 'test';
};
```

- This defines a custom type (similar to an interface in Java).
- It specifies the structure for configuration objects.
- The environment property uses a union type, which is like an enum in Java but more flexible.

## Class Declaration

```typescript
class App extends EventEmitter {
  private config: AppConfig;

  constructor(config: AppConfig) {
    super();
    this.config = config;
  }
}
```

- This declares a class App that extends EventEmitter.
- It has a private field config of type AppConfig.
- The constructor takes an AppConfig object and calls the superclass constructor.
- This is similar to Java, but note the private keyword is used directly in the field declaration.

## Public Method: start

```typescript
public start(): void {
  console.log(`Starting ${this.config.name} v${this.config.version} in ${this.config.environment} mode`);
  this.emit('started');
  setImmediate(() => {
    this.runTask();
  });
}
```

- This is a public method that doesn't return anything (void).
- It logs a message to the console (similar to System.out.println in Java).
- this.emit('started') fires an event named 'started'. This is part of the EventEmitter functionality.
- setImmediate schedules a function to run after the current event loop cycle. It's somewhat like SwingUtilities.invokeLater in Java Swing, but for Node.js's event loop.

## Private Method: runTask

```typescript
private runTask(): void {
  console.log('Running task...');
  setImmediate(() => {
    console.log('Task completed');
    this.emit('taskCompleted');
  });
}
```

- This is a private method, similar to Java.
- It logs messages and uses setImmediate to schedule the completion of the task.
- After the task completes, it emits a 'taskCompleted' event.

## Public Method: getInfo

```typescript
public getInfo(): AppConfig {
  return { ...this.config };
}
```

- This method returns a copy of the config object.
- The { ...this.config } syntax is the spread operator, which creates a shallow copy of the object.
- This is similar to returning a cloned object in Java to prevent direct modification of internal state.

## Export Statement

```typescript
export default App;
```

- This exports the App class as the default export of this module.
- In Java, this would be similar to making the class public in its own file.

## Key Differences from Java

1. TypeScript uses structural typing (duck typing), which is more flexible than Java's nominal typing.
2. The event-driven nature of Node.js (using EventEmitter) is different from traditional Java programming.
3. Asynchronous operations in Node.js (like setImmediate) are handled differently than in Java.
4. TypeScript allows for more concise syntax in many cases (like field declarations in classes).

This file sets up a basic application structure that can be instantiated, started, and can emit events as it runs tasks.
It's a common pattern in Node.js applications to have a central App or Server class that manages the application's lifecycle.
